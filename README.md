When you think of "life hacks," you usually think of productivity techniques. But what about the kind that helps you understand your body on a molecular level? It can be possible! .

Researchers must first determine the function and relationships among the 37 trillion cells that make up the human body. A better understanding of our cellular composition could help people live longer, healthier lives.

This project aims to identify and segment Functional Tissue Units (FTUs) in five human organs.

* This project could help accelerate the world's understanding of the relationships between the organization of cells and tissues. With a better idea of the relationship of cells, researchers will have more information about the function of cells that affect human health. It will be available for use by researchers and pharmaceutical companies alike, potentially improving and prolonging human life.
